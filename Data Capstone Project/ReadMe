In this project, I have utilized different python libraries to integrate, synthesize, and demonstrate my data science knowledge in various ways. 
This project demonstrates a basic way of visualizing data and manipulating it. 
I am still a novice in this field and I am doing my best to understand Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. But days are not that far when 
I will become an expert in this field.
